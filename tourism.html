							The first written mention of Bohušov is from 1255. It was one of
							the settlements that were founded in the area shortly before at
							the initiative of the bishop Bruno von Schauenburg. The area was
							then settled by German colonizers. Knight Herbort of Fulme had a
							castle called Fullstein built here, and Bohušov, that time called
							Gottfriedsdorf, was a group of hamlets that was formed in the
							castle grounds. During the Hussite Wars, the area was devastated.
							In 1570, the Fullstein estate was acquired by the Sedlnický family
							and the village of Gottfriedsdorf was renamed Fullstein. In 1649,
							the castle was conquered and severely damaged by the Swedish
							troops. In 1938, Bohušov was annexed by Nazi Germany and
							administered as a part of Reichsgau Sudetenland. After the World
							War II, the German population was expelled and the village was
							resettled by Czechs

						<p class="card-text">
							The first written mention of Osoblaha is from 1233. The village
							gained the town rights in 1251, which opened the way for its
							subsequent economical development.[4] The Jewish population in
							Osoblaha was first documented in the 14th century. During the 19th
							century they made up 30% of the town's population. However, they
							left the town before the World War II.[4] According to the
							Austrian census of 1910 the town had 2,853 inhabitants, almost all
							of declared themselves to be German-speaking, though this includes
							most Yiddish-speaking Jews, who were not allowed to enter Yiddish
							as a separate language. The main religious groups were Roman
							Catholics with 2,779 (97.4%), followed by Jews with 58 (2%).[5]
							From 1938 to 1945 it was annexed by Nazi Germany and administered
							as a part of Reichsgau Sudetenland. Although Osoblaha was the
							first town in the Czech lands to be liberated in March 1945, the
							bitter fighting caused the destruction of 90% of all buildings.
							The German population was expelled and the town became
							significantly depopulated. In 1960 the municipality lost its town
							status.[4][6]
